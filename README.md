### Face Liveness Detection
PresentID Facial liveness detection can recognize the person in front of the video is real or fake. It can detect if the user is physically present and prevents masks, photos, or video deepfakes to fool the system. We use the convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning algorithms to prevent fraud.
